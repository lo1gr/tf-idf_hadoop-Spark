# tf-idf_hadoop-Spark
Recreation of tf-idf in Hadoop and Spark using MapReduce in Python



Add this code every time to import the corresponding files we want (change the 0 of documents/0/text to the corpus of documents we want to analyze):

for i in {0..9}; do
      wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lo1gr/tf-idf_hadoop-Spark/master/documents/0/text_$i.txt
done



to run the file called 
easy_run.sh:   dothe following in the terminal:
time easy_run.sh

This will output 3 times that we weill use for the experimental analysis.
